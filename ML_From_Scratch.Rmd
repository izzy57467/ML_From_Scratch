## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r titanic}
data <- read.csv("titanic_project.csv")
summary(data)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r split}
train <- data[1:800,]
test <- data[801:1046, ]
```


```{r lr}
str(train)

set.seed(1234)
glm1 = glm(formula = survived ~ sex, data = train, family = binomial)
summary(glm1)
```


```{r test}
probs <- predict(glm1, newdata = test, type = "response")
pred <- ifelse(probs >0.5, 2, 1)
acc1 <- mean(pred==as.integer(test$survived))
print(paste("glm1 accouracy = ", acc1))
table(pred, as.integer(test$survived))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
